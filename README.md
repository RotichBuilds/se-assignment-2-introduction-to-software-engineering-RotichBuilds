Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is a computer science discipline that deals with systamatic application of engineering principlies, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems while programming is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Software Development Life Cycle is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying a software system and provide a sequence of activities for system designers and developers to follow as described in https://www.visual-paradigm.com/.
The phases includes:

Requirements: This involves gathering and documentation of user needs and software system requirements.

Design: Involves creation of high level and detailed designs of the software architecture while adhering to requirements.

Implementation: Involves writing code and building the software to the design specications.

Testing: This is a robust process of evaluating and verifying that the software product or application meets the quality standards and functionality requirements.

Deployment: is the process of making software available to be used on a system by users or customers and other programs

Maintenance:This is a process of changing, modifying and updating the software system to meet or keep up with the customer needs.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall models are designed using sequential and linear approach where each distinct phase must be completed prior to moving to the next, often used in short term projects where requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change, whereas, agile models uses an iterative, incremental, and adaptive approach to software development and emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction, often used for long term projects that are uncertain or have changing requirements.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements and involves activities like elicitation, analysis, specification, and verification to ensure software meets stakeholdersâ€™ needs. This improves project clarity, reduces errors, and aligns expectations and coherence of subsequent phases of software development.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes or components. It simplifies code and makes its more organized and reusable and also allows easier understanding and management of complex systems, as it allows parallel development.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Testing in software development plays a crucial role in ensuring software quality. It enables the development team to make detailed specification reviews, design and code. It helps quality assurance engineer to find and fix defects, maintain and upgrade the quality and functional requirements of the software. 

Unit testing: This involves testing individual components or modules of the software, where where individual code units (functions, methods, classes) are isolated and tested independently.

Integration testing: This is the process of testing interations between different components/modules and how they work together after being unit-tested

System testing: This is a comprehensive evaluation of a software system's overall functionality and performance. It ensures that the entire system meets the development criteria and is critical for detecting system-wide issues such as compatibility problems, performance bottlenecks, and security weaknesses.

Acceptance testing: This is the final stage of software testing, which ensures the software functions properly in the user's working environment. It determines whether the software fits the business requirements and user acceptance criteria as expected or not

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are system helps manage the source code for the software team by keeping track of all the code modifications. They allow for coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team. Examples includes:
Git: It tracks history, free and open source, create backups and allow distributed development

Apache subversion: It supports atomic commits (Either it will occur or not). It keeps a full revision history. It supports Internationalized program message

Mercurial: is a free, distributed source control management tool. It offers you the power to efficiently handle projects of any size while using an intuitive interface. It is easy to use and hard to break, making it ideal for anyone working with versioned files.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A software project manager role is in the context of software development is responsible in overseeing preparation, execution and implementation throughout the entire software project life cycle and also to ensure that it is working as per desired schedule.

Some of the key resposibilities are:
    Communicating effectively to the team members to ensure smooth running of project activities.
    Delegating work among the team the effectively
    Monitoring work and tracking roadblocks
    Managing project deliverables and deployment.

Some of the challlenges faced in managing software projects are:
    Meeting tight and unrealistic deadlines
    Misalignment between goals and business objectives due to poor planning
    Scope creep: this includes adding additional features or functions to the software project.
    Technical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is modifying and updating software after it has been deployed which essentially serve to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime.
Type of software maintenance includes:
    Corrective software maintenance: This addresses the errors and faults within software applications that could impact various parts of your software, including the design, logic, and code. 
    
    Adaptive software maintenance: This is brought by changes to the operating system, hardware, software dependencies, Cloud storage, or even changes within the operating system
    
    Perfective software maintenance: It focuses on the changes of requirements and features that existing in your system by adding features that can enhance user experience and removing features that are not effective and functional.  
    
    Preventive software maintenance: This type helps to prevent the deterioration of your software as it continues to adapt and change by  optimizing code and updating documentation as needed.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Some of the ethical issues faced by software engineers includes:
    Data privacy: There are data privacy frameworks like GDPR and CCPA that aim to protect a user's online privacy and data in consideration of user consent, data minimization, third-party sharing and right to access, correct and delete.

    Accessibility: Software should be more accessible, from providing alt text on images to making software compatible with assistive technologies like screen readers, magnifiers, and speech recognition software.

    Addictive design: Addictive design features including excessive notifications, endless feeds and autoplaying, social validation features and reward and gamification features encourage constant engagement and usage over user's wellbeing. This calls for software engineers to consider the impact of new features on a user's well-being.

    Algorithmic bias: There is need to be aware of data biases, use diverse datasets to train your algorithms and involve a variety of diverse people when developing and reviewing your algorithms to avoid developement of defect project models.

    Software security: Software engineers should endeavor to use secure coding practices to protect both the software itself and the people who use it.
